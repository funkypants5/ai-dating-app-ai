# AI Dating App - AI Service

This is the AI microservice component of the AI Dating App ecosystem. It provides AI-powered features like bio generation, matching algorithms, and conversation starters using LangChain and Google Gemini.

## Architecture

This AI service works as a separate microservice that communicates with the frontend:

```
Frontend (React Native) â†’ AI Service (FastAPI)
```

## Features

- **Bio Generation**: Creates personalized dating bios based on user interests
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Improves user responses to dating prompts
- **Lovabot**: AI dating coach with RAG-powered advice from dating articles
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Analyzes user compatibility (planned)
- **Conversation Starters**: Generates ice-breaker messages (planned)
- **Content Moderation**: AI-powered content filtering (planned)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
- Google Gemini API key (for embeddings)
- Access to the main NestJS backend

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-dating-app-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.copy .env

   # Edit .env file and add your API keys
   # Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys
   ```

4. **Get API Keys**

   - **OpenAI API Key**: Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - **Google Gemini API Key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Copy the keys and paste them in your `.env` file

5. **One-Time Setup: Generate Lovabot Embeddings**

   ```bash
   # Run this once to process all PDFs and create embeddings
   python setup_embeddings.py
   ```

   This will:

   - Read all PDF files from `ai/ai_lovabot/data/` folder
   - Process and create embeddings for the dating articles
   - Save embeddings to `ai/ai_lovabot/embeddings.pkl`
   - Commit the `.pkl` file to git so others don't need to run this step

## Running the Service

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server using the new fastapi dev command, this allows FastAPI to listen on all ports
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000`

## API Documentation

Once running, visit:

- **Swagger UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (recommended)
- **ReDoc**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

}
```

## Integration with Main Backend

This AI service is designed to be called by the main NestJS backend:

1. **NestJS Backend** receives user requests
2. **Calls AI Service** via HTTP requests
3. **AI Service** processes with LangChain + Gemini
4. **Returns results** to NestJS backend
5. **NestJS** sends response to frontend

### Example NestJS Integration:

```typescript
// In your NestJS service
async generateBio(interests: string[]) {
  const response = await this.httpService.post(
    'http://127.0.0.1:8000/bio',
    { bio_interests: interests }
  ).toPromise();
  return response.data;
}
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key_here  # Optional for tracing
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=your_project_name        # Optional for tracing
```

### Adding New AI Features

1. Create new prompt files in `ai/profile_management/` or create new folder
2. Add new endpoints in `main.py`
3. Update this README with new API documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API key errors**: Verify your Google Gemini API key is correct
2. **Port conflicts**: Change the port in the uvicorn command if 8000 is taken

### Logs

The service uses LangSmith for tracing. Check your LangSmith dashboard for detailed AI interaction logs.
