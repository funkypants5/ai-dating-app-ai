# ü§ñ AI Date Planner - Rules & Considerations

## üìã Overview

The AI Date Planner uses a **hybrid approach** combining:

- **Rule-based filtering** (deterministic)
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** (AI-powered semantic search)
- **LLM integration** (Gemini for natural language output)

## üéØ Core Planning Rules

### 1. **Duration-Based Activity Planning**

The system automatically suggests different numbers of activities based on date duration:

| Duration     | Activities     | Rules                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **3+ hours** | 2 activities   | Basic food + 1 attraction/activity                                       |
| **4+ hours** | 3 activities   | Basic food + attraction + coffee break                                   |
| **6+ hours** | 3-4 activities | Basic food + attraction + coffee break + additional cultural/nature spot |

### 2. **Time-Based Meal Planning**

The system plans meals based on **actual time windows** with intelligent sequential planning:

#### üçΩÔ∏è **Meal Time Windows**

| Meal Type            | Time Window   | Duration  | Conditions                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coffee/Breakfast** | 6:00 - 11:00  | 1.0 hour  | If date starts between 6-11 AM                                    |
| **Lunch**            | 12:00 - 14:00 | 1.5 hours | If date spans lunch time (starts before 12:00, ends after 12:00)  |
| **Coffee Break**     | 14:00 - 16:00 | 1.0 hour  | If date spans 14:00-16:00 AND max 1 coffee break per date         |
| **Dinner**           | 17:00 - 20:00 | 2.0 hours | If date spans dinner time (starts before 20:00, ends after 17:00) |
| **Late Dinner**      | 21:00 - 02:00 | 2.0 hours | If date starts after 21:00 OR before 2 AM                         |

#### üéØ **Smart Meal Logic**

- **Sequential planning** - Activities planned one after another with travel time
- **Flexible durations** - Meal durations adapt to available time (minimum 30 minutes)
- **Meal prioritization** - Meals are prioritized over activities when time windows align
- **Travel time integration** - Realistic travel time calculated between all locations
- **Coffee break limits** - Maximum 1 coffee break per date to prevent duplicates

#### üìÖ **Example Scenarios**

- **7:00-10:00 (3 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities (no lunch - doesn't span 12:00-14:00)
- **9:00-13:00 (4 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities + Lunch (spans 12:00-14:00, lunch duration adapts to 0.6 hours)
- **14:00-17:00 (3 hours):** Lunch + Coffee Break (spans lunch and coffee break windows)
- **15:00-19:00 (4 hours):** Activities + Dinner (spans 17:00-20:00)
- **18:00-21:00 (3 hours):** Dinner + Activities (spans 17:00-20:00)
- **10:00-18:00 (8 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities + Lunch + Coffee Break + Activities (no dinner - doesn't span 17:00-20:00)
- **9:00-19:00 (10 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities + Lunch + Coffee Break + Activities (no dinner - doesn't span 17:00-20:00)
- **21:00-01:00 (4 hours):** Late Dinner + Activities (Late Dinner for night dates)
- **14:00-21:00 (7 hours):** Lunch + Coffee Break + Sports + Dinner (perfect sports date with all meals)

## üîß Hardcoded Elements

### **Activity Types (Partially Hardcoded)**

#### ‚úÖ **Dynamic Activity Types:**

- **Sports Activity** - Based on location analysis (swimming, tennis, fitness, etc.)
- **Swimming** - For swimming pools/aquatic centers
- **Tennis** - For tennis courts
- **Fitness** - For gyms/fitness centers
- **Sports** - For stadiums/fields

#### ‚ùå **Hardcoded Activity Types:**

- `"Coffee/Breakfast"` - For 6:00-11:00 time window
- `"Lunch"` - For 11:00-15:00 time window
- `"Dinner"` - For 17:00-22:00 time window
- `"Late Dinner"` - For 21:00-02:00 time window
- `"Coffee Break"` - For 14:00-17:00 time window
- `"Walk"` - For park/nature attractions
- `"Cultural Visit"` - For museums/galleries
- `"Sports Activity"` - For sports facilities (dynamically categorized)

### **Duration Times (Flexible)**

| Activity Type    | Duration      | Time Window | Notes                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Coffee/Breakfast | 1.0 hours     | 6:00-11:00  | Fixed                                              |
| Lunch            | 1.5 hours     | 12:00-14:00 | **Flexible** - adapts to available time (min 0.5h) |
| Dinner           | 2.0 hours     | 17:00-20:00 | Fixed                                              |
| Late Dinner      | 2.0 hours     | 21:00-02:00 | Fixed                                              |
| Coffee Break     | 1.0 hours     | 14:00-16:00 | Fixed                                              |
| Walk             | 0.5-2.0 hours | Any time    | Variable based on available time                   |
| Cultural Visit   | 0.5-3.0 hours | Any time    | Variable based on available time                   |
| Sports Activity  | 1.0-4.0 hours | Any time    | Variable based on available time                   |

### **Activity Sequencing (Dynamic)**

The system now uses **flexible sequencing** based on time windows:

1. **Food always comes first** (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
2. **Attractions come second** (walks, museums, parks)
3. **Activities come last** (sports, entertainment)

### **Budget Tiers (Hardcoded)**

| Budget Tier | Price Range         | Keywords                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `$`         | $20-$40 per person  | "budget", "affordable", "cheap", "casual"      |
| `$$`        | $40-$70 per person  | "moderate", "mid-range", "casual", "family"    |
| `$$$`       | $70-$100 per person | "upscale", "fine dining", "premium", "luxury"  |
| `$$$$`      | $100+ per person    | "high-end", "exclusive", "gourmet", "michelin" |

## üéõÔ∏è User Input Considerations

### **Required Inputs:**

- `start_time` - When the date begins (HH:MM format)
- `start_latitude` & `start_longitude` - Starting location coordinates
- `budget_tier` - $, $$, $$$, or $$$$

### **Optional Inputs:**

- `end_time` - When the date ends (defaults to 4 hours after start)
- `interests` - Array of interests (defaults to ['food', 'culture', 'nature'])
- `date_type` - casual, romantic, adventurous, cultural (defaults to 'casual')
- `preferred_location_types` - Array of types (defaults to all types)

### **Auto-Detected:**

- `time_of_day` - Automatically detected from start_time:
  - 6:00-12:00 ‚Üí "morning"
  - 12:00-17:00 ‚Üí "afternoon"
  - 17:00-21:00 ‚Üí "evening"
  - 21:00-02:00 ‚Üí "night"

## üîç Filtering Rules

### **Rule-Based Filtering (Step 1)**

1. **Location Type Filter** - Filters by preferred types (food, attraction, activity, heritage)
2. **Interest Filter** - **Smart filtering** - If no interests specified, includes all locations. If interests specified, only includes matching locations (except food locations which are always included for meals)
3. **Budget Filter** - Filters by budget tier keywords
4. **Time Filter** - **Very lenient** - only excludes locations that explicitly conflict
5. **Date Type Filter** - **Very lenient** - only excludes locations that explicitly conflict

### **RAG-Based Relevance (Step 2)**

- Uses **Sentence-BERT embeddings** for semantic similarity
- Combines **70% semantic relevance** + **30% proximity score**
- Returns top 50 most relevant locations

### **Proximity Scoring**

- Calculates distance from `start_latitude`/`start_longitude`
- Uses **Haversine formula** for accurate distance calculation
- Scores range from 0-1 (higher = closer)

## üìç Address System

### **Address Formatting:**

#### **Sports Facilities:**

```
"21, Evans Road, Singapore 259366"
```

#### **Restaurants:**

```
"Block 123, Main Street, #01-01, Singapore"
```

#### **Tourist Attractions:**

```
"MacRitchie Reservoir Park"
```

### **Address Sources:**

- **GeoJSON files** - Extracted from HTML description tables
- **KML files** - Extracted from ExtendedData fields
- **Restaurant data** - Built from BLK_HOUSE + STR_NAME + UNIT_NO

## ‚è∞ Travel Time & Timing System

### **Travel Time Calculation:**

The system now calculates **realistic travel time** between locations:

- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance
- **Speed Assumption**: 30 km/h average in Singapore (including traffic/public transport)
- **Travel Time Range**: 6 minutes to 1 hour (capped for realism)
- **Default Fallback**: 15 minutes if coordinates missing

### **Timing Format:**

#### **Before (Unclear):**

```
‚Ä¢ 10:00: Coffee/Breakfast at Restaurant
‚Ä¢ 11:00: Morning Walk at Park
```

#### **After (Clear Start/End Times):**

```
‚Ä¢ 10:00-11:00: Coffee/Breakfast at Restaurant
‚Ä¢ 11:06-13:06: Morning Walk at Park (6 min travel time included)
```

### **Travel Time Examples:**

- **Same area**: 6-10 minutes travel time
- **Different districts**: 15-30 minutes travel time
- **Cross-island**: 30-60 minutes travel time

### **Real Examples from the System:**

#### **Morning Coffee Date (3 hours):**

```
‚Ä¢ 09:00-10:00: Coffee/Breakfast at HUA FONG KEE FOOD COURT PTE LTD
‚Ä¢ 10:06-12:06: Morning Walk at MacRitchie Singapore & Singapore Nature Reserve
  (6 minutes travel time from food court to nature reserve)
```

#### **Full Day Date (7 hours):**

```
‚Ä¢ 10:00-11:00: Coffee/Breakfast at AH SIN FAMILY EATING HOUSE
‚Ä¢ 11:06-13:06: Morning Walk at MacRitchie Singapore & Singapore Nature Reserve
  (6 minutes travel time from restaurant to nature reserve)
‚Ä¢ 13:12-17:12: Light Activity at Co Curricular Activities Branch
  (6 minutes travel time from nature reserve to sports center)
```

### **Technical Implementation:**

- **Haversine Formula**: Accurate distance calculation between coordinates
- **Singapore-Specific**: 30 km/h average speed (realistic for traffic + public transport)
- **Fallback Handling**: 15 minutes default if coordinates missing
- **Time Capping**: Maximum 1 hour travel time (prevents unrealistic estimates)
- **Automatic Calculation**: No manual input needed - system calculates everything

### **Key Benefits:**

1. **Realistic Timing**: No more impossible back-to-back activities
2. **Clear Communication**: Users know exactly when each activity starts and ends
3. **Google Maps Ready**: Travel times are realistic for Singapore
4. **Automatic**: No manual input needed - system calculates everything
5. **Flexible**: Works for any location combination
