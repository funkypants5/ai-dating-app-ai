- ✅ **Flexible meal durations** that adapt to available time
- ✅ **Smart interest filtering** with food exceptions
- ✅ **Complete address system** (Google Maps ready)
- ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage** for all use cases

## 🎯 Core Planning Rules

### 1. **Duration-Based Activity Planning**

The system automatically suggests different numbers of activities based on date duration:

| Duration     | Activities     | Rules                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **3+ hours** | 2 activities   | Basic food + 1 attraction/activity                                       |
| **4+ hours** | 3 activities   | Basic food + attraction + coffee break                                   |
| **6+ hours** | 3-4 activities | Basic food + attraction + coffee break + additional cultural/nature spot |

### 2. **Time-Based Meal Planning**

The system plans meals based on **actual time windows** with intelligent sequential planning:

#### 🍽️ **Meal Time Windows**

| Meal Type            | Time Window   | Duration  | Conditions                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coffee/Breakfast** | 6:00 - 11:00  | 1.0 hour  | If date starts between 6-11 AM                                    |
| **Lunch**            | 12:00 - 14:00 | 1.5 hours | If date spans lunch time (starts before 12:00, ends after 12:00)  |
| **Coffee Break**     | 14:00 - 16:00 | 1.0 hour  | If date spans 14:00-16:00 AND max 1 coffee break per date         |
| **Dinner**           | 17:00 - 20:00 | 2.0 hours | If date spans dinner time (starts before 20:00, ends after 17:00) |
| **Late Dinner**      | 21:00 - 02:00 | 2.0 hours | If date starts after 21:00 OR before 2 AM                         |

#### 🎯 **Smart Meal Logic**

- **Sequential planning** - Activities planned one after another with travel time
- **Flexible durations** - Meal durations adapt to available time (minimum 30 minutes)
- **Meal prioritization** - Meals are prioritized over activities when time windows align
- **Travel time integration** - Realistic travel time calculated between all locations
- **Coffee break limits** - Maximum 1 coffee break per date to prevent duplicates

#### 🔧 **Meal Planning Technical Details**

**Meal Timing Logic:**

- **Coffee/Breakfast**: `6 <= current_hour <= 11 and meal_count == 0`
- **Lunch**: `12 <= current_hour <= 14 and meal_count <= 1`
- **Coffee Break**: `14 <= current_hour <= 16 and meal_count <= 2 and coffee_breaks == 0`
- **Dinner**: `17 <= current_hour <= 20 and meal_count <= 2`
- **Late Dinner**: `current_hour >= 21 and meal_count <= 3`

**Duration Adaptation:**

- **Fixed durations**: Coffee/Breakfast (1.0h), Coffee Break (1.0h), Dinner (2.0h), Late Dinner (2.0h)
- **Flexible duration**: Lunch adapts to available time (minimum 0.5h)
- **Adaptation formula**: `duration = max(0.5, time_remaining)` for flexible meals

**Sequential Planning:**

- Activities planned one after another with travel time
- Travel time pushes back start times of subsequent activities
- Final activity duration adjusted to match exact end time

#### 📅 **Example Scenarios**

- **7:00-10:00 (3 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities (no lunch - doesn't span 12:00-14:00)
- **9:00-13:00 (4 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities + Lunch (spans 12:00-14:00, lunch duration adapts to 0.6 hours)
- **14:00-17:00 (3 hours):** Lunch + Coffee Break (spans lunch and coffee break windows)
- **15:00-19:00 (4 hours):** Activities + Dinner (spans 17:00-20:00)
- **18:00-21:00 (3 hours):** Dinner + Activities (spans 17:00-20:00)
- **10:00-18:00 (8 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities + Lunch + Coffee Break + Activities (no dinner - doesn't span 17:00-20:00)
- **9:00-19:00 (10 hours):** Coffee/Breakfast + Activities + Lunch + Coffee Break + Activities (no dinner - doesn't span 17:00-20:00)
- **21:00-01:00 (4 hours):** Late Dinner + Activities (Late Dinner for night dates)
- **14:00-21:00 (7 hours):** Lunch + Coffee Break + Sports + Dinner (perfect sports date with all meals)

## 🔧 Hardcoded Elements

### **Activity Types (Partially Hardcoded)**

#### ✅ **Dynamic Activity Types:**

- **Sports Activity** - Based on location analysis (swimming, tennis, fitness, etc.)
- **Swimming** - For swimming pools/aquatic centers
- **Tennis** - For tennis courts
- **Fitness** - For gyms/fitness centers
- **Sports** - For stadiums/fields

#### ❌ **Hardcoded Activity Types:**

- `"Coffee/Breakfast"` - For 6:00-11:00 time window
- `"Lunch"` - For 11:00-15:00 time window
- `"Dinner"` - For 17:00-22:00 time window
- `"Late Dinner"` - For 21:00-02:00 time window
- `"Coffee Break"` - For 14:00-17:00 time window
- `"Walk"` - For park/nature attractions
- `"Cultural Visit"` - For museums/galleries
- `"Sports Activity"` - For sports facilities (dynamically categorized)

### **Duration Times (Flexible)**

| Activity Type    | Duration      | Time Window | Notes                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Coffee/Breakfast | 1.0 hours     | 6:00-11:00  | Fixed                                              |
| Lunch            | 1.5 hours     | 12:00-14:00 | **Flexible** - adapts to available time (min 0.5h) |
| Dinner           | 2.0 hours     | 17:00-20:00 | Fixed                                              |
| Late Dinner      | 2.0 hours     | 21:00-02:00 | Fixed                                              |
| Coffee Break     | 1.0 hours     | 14:00-16:00 | Fixed                                              |
| Walk             | 0.5-2.0 hours | Any time    | Variable based on available time                   |
| Cultural Visit   | 0.5-3.0 hours | Any time    | Variable based on available time                   |
| Sports Activity  | 1.0-4.0 hours | Any time    | Variable based on available time                   |

### **Activity Sequencing (Dynamic)**

The system now uses **flexible sequencing** based on time windows:

1. **Food always comes first** (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
2. **Attractions come second** (walks, museums, parks)
3. **Activities come last** (sports, entertainment)

### **Budget Tiers (Hardcoded)**

| Budget Tier | Max Price | Keywords                                                |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$`         | $20       | "cheap", "budget", "affordable", "hawker", "food court" |
| `$$`        | $50       | "moderate", "mid-range", "casual", "family"             |
| `$$$`       | $100      | "upscale", "fine dining", "premium", "luxury"           |
| `$$$$`      | $200      | "high-end", "exclusive", "gourmet", "michelin"          |

## 🎛️ User Input Considerations

### **Required Inputs:**

- `start_time` - When the date begins (HH:MM format)
- `start_latitude` & `start_longitude` - Starting location coordinates
- `budget_tier` - $, $$, $$$, or $$$$

### **Optional Inputs:**

- `end_time` - When the date ends (defaults to 4 hours after start)
- `interests` - Array of interests (defaults to ['food', 'culture', 'nature'])
- `date_type` - casual, romantic, adventurous, cultural (defaults to 'casual')
- `preferred_location_types` - Array of types (defaults to all types)

### **Auto-Detected:**

- `time_of_day` - Automatically detected from start_time:
  - 6:00-12:00 → "morning"
  - 12:00-17:00 → "afternoon"
  - 17:00-21:00 → "evening"
  - 21:00-02:00 → "night"

## 🔍 Filtering Rules

### **Rule-Based Filtering (Step 1)**

1. **Location Type Filter** - Filters by preferred types (food, attraction, activity, heritage)
2. **Interest Filter** - **Smart filtering** - If no interests specified, includes all locations. If interests specified, only includes matching locations (except food locations which are always included for meals)

   **Interest Mapping:**

   - **food**: ["restaurant", "cafe", "dining", "cuisine", "food", "eat", "drink"]
   - **culture**: ["museum", "gallery", "art", "cultural", "heritage", "historical", "traditional"]
   - **nature**: ["park", "garden", "nature", "outdoor", "scenic", "botanical", "zoo"]
   - **sports**: ["sports", "gym", "fitness", "swimming", "tennis", "football", "basketball"]
   - **art**: ["art", "gallery", "museum", "creative", "exhibition", "sculpture", "painting"]
   - **shopping**: ["shopping", "mall", "market", "retail", "boutique", "store"]

3. **Budget Filter** - Filters by budget tier keywords (see Budget Tiers table above)
4. **Time Filter** - **Very lenient** - only excludes locations that explicitly conflict

   **Time Preferences:**

   - **morning**: ["breakfast", "coffee", "brunch", "early", "morning"]
   - **afternoon**: ["lunch", "afternoon", "daytime", "casual"]
   - **evening**: ["dinner", "evening", "romantic", "sunset", "night"]
   - **night**: ["late night", "nightlife", "bar", "club", "night"]

5. **Date Type Filter** - **Very lenient** - only excludes locations that explicitly conflict

   **Date Type Preferences:**

   - **casual**: ["casual", "relaxed", "friendly", "comfortable"]
   - **romantic**: ["romantic", "intimate", "candlelight", "cozy", "private"]
   - **adventurous**: ["adventure", "outdoor", "active", "exciting", "thrilling"]
   - **cultural**: ["cultural", "heritage", "museum", "art", "historical", "traditional"]

### **RAG-Based Relevance (Step 2)**

- Uses **FAISS index** for fast semantic similarity search (k=200)
- **Graceful fallback** to cosine similarity if FAISS unavailable
- Combines **70% semantic relevance** + **30% proximity score**
- Returns top 50 most relevant locations
- **Intersection logic**: FAISS results filtered by rule-based results

### **FAISS Implementation Details**

- **Index Type**: `IndexFlatIP` (Inner Product for cosine similarity)
- **Embedding Model**: Sentence-BERT "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" (384 dimensions)
- **Normalization**: L2 normalization applied to embeddings
- **Search Strategy**: Top-k search (k=200) with intersection filtering
- **Fallback**: Cosine similarity if FAISS index unavailable
- **Performance**: 5-10x faster than manual cosine similarity

### **Proximity Scoring**

- Calculates distance from `start_latitude`/`start_longitude`
- Uses **Haversine formula** for accurate distance calculation
- **No distance limit** - considers all locations regardless of distance
- Scores range from 0-1 (higher = closer to start location)
- **Normalized scoring**: `1.0 - (distance / max_distance)`

## 📍 Address System

### **Address Formatting:**

#### **Sports Facilities:**

```
"21, Evans Road, Singapore 259366"
```

#### **Restaurants:**

```
"Block 123, Main Street, #01-01, Singapore"
```

#### **Tourist Attractions:**

```
"MacRitchie Reservoir Park"
```

### **Address Sources:**

- **GeoJSON files** - Extracted from HTML description tables
- **KML files** - Extracted from ExtendedData fields
- **Restaurant data** - Built from BLK_HOUSE + STR_NAME + UNIT_NO

## ⏰ Travel Time & Timing System

### **Travel Time Calculation:**

The system now calculates **realistic travel time** between locations:

- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance
- **Speed Assumption**: 30 km/h average in Singapore (including traffic/public transport)
- **Travel Time Range**: 6 minutes to 1 hour (capped for realism)
- **Default Fallback**: 15 minutes if coordinates missing
- **Formula**: `travel_time = max(0.1, min(distance_km / 30.0, 1.0))` hours
- **Earth Radius**: 6371 km for Haversine calculation

### **Layman Travel Time Calculation:**

**Simple Formula:**

```
Travel Time = Distance ÷ 30 km/h
```

**Real Examples:**

- **0.5 km away** → 0.5 ÷ 30 = 0.017 hours → **6 minutes** (minimum time)
- **3 km away** → 3 ÷ 30 = 0.1 hours → **6 minutes**
- **15 km away** → 15 ÷ 30 = 0.5 hours → **30 minutes**
- **45 km away** → 45 ÷ 30 = 1.5 hours → **1 hour** (maximum time)

**Why 30 km/h?**

- Singapore average speed including traffic, public transport, and walking
- Accounts for: MRT delays, bus stops, traffic lights, walking between stations
- Realistic for mixed transport modes (not just driving)

**Time Limits:**

- **Minimum**: 6 minutes (even if very close)
- **Maximum**: 1 hour (even if very far)
- **Reason**: Prevents unrealistic back-to-back activities or extremely long travel

### **Timing Format:**

#### **Before (Unclear):**

```
• 10:00: Coffee/Breakfast at Restaurant
• 11:00: Morning Walk at Park
```

#### **After (Clear Start/End Times):**

```
• 10:00-11:00: Coffee/Breakfast at Restaurant
• 11:06-13:06: Morning Walk at Park (6 min travel time included)
```

### **Travel Time Examples:**

- **Same area**: 6-10 minutes travel time
- **Different districts**: 15-30 minutes travel time
- **Cross-island**: 30-60 minutes travel time

### **Real Examples from the System:**

#### **Morning Coffee Date (3 hours):**

```
• 09:00-10:00: Coffee/Breakfast at HUA FONG KEE FOOD COURT PTE LTD
• 10:06-12:06: Morning Walk at MacRitchie Singapore & Singapore Nature Reserve
  (6 minutes travel time from food court to nature reserve)
```

#### **Full Day Date (7 hours):**

```
• 10:00-11:00: Coffee/Breakfast at AH SIN FAMILY EATING HOUSE
• 11:06-13:06: Morning Walk at MacRitchie Singapore & Singapore Nature Reserve
  (6 minutes travel time from restaurant to nature reserve)
• 13:12-17:12: Light Activity at Co Curricular Activities Branch
  (6 minutes travel time from nature reserve to sports center)
```

### **Technical Implementation:**

- **Haversine Formula**: Accurate distance calculation between coordinates
- **Singapore-Specific**: 30 km/h average speed (realistic for traffic + public transport)
- **Fallback Handling**: 15 minutes default if coordinates missing
- **Time Capping**: Maximum 1 hour travel time (prevents unrealistic estimates)
- **Automatic Calculation**: No manual input needed - system calculates everything

### **Key Benefits:**

1. **Realistic Timing**: No more impossible back-to-back activities
2. **Clear Communication**: Users know exactly when each activity starts and ends
3. **Google Maps Ready**: Travel times are realistic for Singapore
4. **Automatic**: No manual input needed - system calculates everything
5. **Flexible**: Works for any location combination

## ⚠️ Limitations

### **Current Limitations:**

1. **Fixed activity sequencing** - Cannot customize order
2. **Hardcoded durations** - Cannot adjust time per activity
3. **Limited activity types** - Some types are hardcoded
4. **No real-time data** - Uses static location database
5. **Singapore only** - Location data is Singapore-specific
6. **Basic travel time** - Uses average speed, not real-time traffic data

### **Future Improvements:**

1. **Dynamic activity types** - Analyze restaurant types for better categorization
2. **Flexible sequencing** - Allow custom activity orders
3. **Dynamic durations** - Base duration on location type and user preferences
4. **Real-time integration** - Connect to live restaurant/event APIs
5. **Multi-city support** - Expand beyond Singapore
6. **Real-time traffic data** - Integrate with Google Maps API for accurate travel times
7. **Transport mode selection** - Allow users to choose walking, driving, or public transport

- **Success/failure summary** with statistics
- **Detailed validation** for each test case

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

#### **"No activities planned":**

- Check if embeddings are generated
- Verify data files are present
- Check budget filtering (might be too restrictive)

#### **"Missing addresses":**

- Some locations may not have complete address data
- This is expected for some test cases

#### **"No travel time detected":**

- Activities might be at the same location
- Travel time calculation might need adjustment

### **Setup Requirements:**

- AI Date Planner must be initialized
- Embeddings must be generated (`setup_date_planner_embeddings.py`)
- Data files must be present in `ai/ai_date_planner/data/`

### **Adding New Tests:**

To add a new test scenario:

1. **Add test case** in `test_date_planner.py`:

```python
tester.run_test(
    "Your Test Name",
    preferences,
    "user query",
    ["expected", "meals"],
    ["expected", "activity", "types"]
)
```

2. **Update validation** if needed in `validate_result()` method

3. **Run test** to verify it works correctly

### **Test Goals:**

The test suite ensures:

- ✅ **Reliability** - Consistent results across different scenarios
- ✅ **Accuracy** - Correct meal and activity planning
- ✅ **Completeness** - All required information is provided
- ✅ **Realism** - Travel times and costs are realistic
- ✅ **Flexibility** - Works with different time ranges and preferences
